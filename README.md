🧠 End-to-End Data Analysis Pipeline: Python + SQL Server
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow from dataset acquisition to SQL-based insights, integrating Python, Pandas, and Microsoft SQL Server.

📌 Project Overview:
Using a dataset from Kaggle, the following steps were performed:

🔽 Dataset Download

Utilized the Kaggle API to programmatically download the dataset using Python.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Leveraged Pandas for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data.

Handled null values, inconsistent types, and performed feature engineering where required.

🗃️ Data Upload to SQL Server

Loaded the processed data into Microsoft SQL Server using SQLAlchemy.

📈 Data Analysis & Visualization (SQL Side)

Ran SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Extracted insights such as trends, aggregations, and segmentations.

Visualized results using charts and graphs (via Python/SQL BI tools).

📂 Tech Stack:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, SQLAlchemy

Microsoft SQL Server
